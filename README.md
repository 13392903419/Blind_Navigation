## 🌟 Introduction

Blind Navigation is an innovative AI-powered navigation system designed for visually impaired individuals. It combines computer vision and artificial intelligence to identify tactile paving (guide paths) through real-time video analysis and provides intelligent voice guidance. The system also includes location sharing, AI map assistant, and other features to enhance travel safety and independence.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.8+)
- **AI Models**:
  - YOLO (You Only Look Once) - Tactile paving detection
  - Ollama (Qwen2.5:3b) - Personalized voice prompt generation
  - DeepSeek AI - Intelligent dialogue and route planning
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Third-party Services**:
  - Baidu Map API - Location services and route planning
  - Edge TTS / pyttsx3 - Text-to-speech synthesis

## 🎯 Problems Solved

This system addresses the following challenges:

1. **Tactile Paving Recognition & Navigation**: Real-time video analysis to identify tactile paving position and direction changes, helping visually impaired individuals walk safely

2. **Real-time Voice Feedback**: Automatically provides personalized AI voice prompts when tactile paving direction changes are detected

3. **Intelligent Map Assistant**: Integrates DeepSeek AI and Baidu Map API for intelligent Q&A, location queries, route planning, and more

4. **Safety Monitoring**: Location sharing allows family members to remotely view the location of visually impaired individuals

5. **Personalized Experience**: Customizable voice speed, volume, address preferences, and other parameters

6. **Accessibility Design**: Reduces barriers for visually impaired individuals to use modern urban facilities

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎥 **Real-time Video Analysis**: Uses YOLO model for real-time tactile paving detection
- 🔊 **Intelligent Voice Feedback**: Uses Ollama (qwen2.5:3b) to generate personalized, context-aware voice prompts based on user profile (age, gender, name, preferences)
- 🤖 **AI Map Assistant**: Natural language interaction using DeepSeek AI, supports location queries, route planning, nearby searches, etc.
- 👤 **User System**: Complete registration, login, and password recovery functionality
- 📍 **Location Sharing**: Real-time location sharing for family members
- ⚙️ **Personalized Settings**: Customizable voice speed, volume, gender, age group, address preferences, etc.
- 🎯 **Dual Mode**: Supports both visually impaired user mode and family member mode

### How Ollama Powers Navigation

When the system detects a change in tactile paving direction (left or right turn), it uses the Ollama qwen2.5:3b model to generate natural, personalized voice prompts. The AI considers:
- User's preferred name or nickname
- Age group (youth/middle-aged/senior) for appropriate tone
- Gender for voice selection
- Encouragement settings to provide motivational feedback
- Previous context to avoid repetitive messages

This creates a more human-like and engaging experience compared to static, pre-recorded messages.

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Database
- Ollama with qwen2.5:3b model installed
- YOLO model weights file (requires training or using provided model)
- Required Python libraries (see installation steps below)

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wink-wink-wink555/blind_navigation.git
cd blind_navigation
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install packages individually:

```bash
pip install flask pymysql ultralytics ollama numpy pyttsx3 geopy Pillow edge-tts requests opencv-python Werkzeug
```

### 4. Install and Configure Ollama

Install Ollama and pull the qwen2.5:3b model:

```bash
# Visit https://ollama.com/ to download and install Ollama for your OS

# After installation, pull the qwen2.5:3b model
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b

# Verify the model is installed
ollama list
```

Make sure Ollama service is running on `http://localhost:11434` (default port).

### 5. Database Setup

Create MySQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE blind_navigation CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

The application will automatically create required tables on first run.

### 6. Configuration

Modify configuration in `config.py` (copy from `config.example.py`):

- **Database Config** (`DB_CONFIG`): Set MySQL host, user, password, etc.
- **Email Config** (`EMAIL_CONFIG`): Configure QQ email SMTP service (for verification codes)
- **Baidu Map Config** (`BAIDU_MAP_CONFIG`): Set Baidu Map API key
- **DeepSeek AI Config** (`DEEPSEEK_CONFIG`): Set DeepSeek AI API key
- **YOLO Model Path** (`MODEL_WEIGHTS`): Set path to trained YOLO model weights

### 7. Prepare YOLO Model

- If you have a trained model: Configure the model weights file path in `config.py` under `MODEL_WEIGHTS`
- If you need to train a model: Use your own tactile paving dataset for training (based on ultralytics library)
